##Code test

Using https://stackblitz.com/ or https://codesandbox.io/ create a React application
that will load a list of users from this api https://randomuser.me/
Store the result of the request and display the information in a grid of cards styled
as seen below.

Include following functionality in the list:

-   A search bar that will filter the list based on the
    user input.
-   Ability to sort the list by the information on the
    fields.
-   Ability to edit a list item and have the card
    update with the new information (only in local state
    not through the api)
    You can use JS libraries such as lodash or underscore
    and a CSS or SCSS normalizer to make it easier to
    accomplish this task but we are most interested in your
    own code so please refrain from bringing in other
    libraries. Try to Include comments in the app letting us
    know your thought process. Save the project on
    stackblitz and share the code link with us.
